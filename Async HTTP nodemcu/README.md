This is created for a specific example

establish a communication between two Node MCUs and design a logic if "load 1 on Node MCU -1" is "On' then "load 2 at Node MCU is OFF", add time schedule of load from 10 pm to 6 am.

Example: Suppose load 1 is ON at 10 PM then load 2 will remain off,
load 1 is scheduled to be turned OFF by 3 am then at 3 am load 2 will be turned On.
